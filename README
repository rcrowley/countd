NAME
	countd

SYNOPSIS
	countd-read
	countd-write
	countd-worker

DESCRIPTION
	countd is a very specialized database server for storing a large number
	of counters.  Each counter is identified by a key within a keyspace.
	Keys within a keyspace are kept sorted in descending order by count on
	disk to optimize the primary read pattern of reading the top N keys from
	a keyspace.

	Read-your-own-writes consistency is not guaranteed or even likely.  This
	allows the multiprocess design.  Readers and writers may be run behind a
	TCP load balancer.  Workers may be pooled.  The pieces are independent
	and take care not to step on each other's toes.

PROTOCOL
	Writes are fixed-length packets containing an 8-byte counter and two
	fixed-length, null-padded strings.  The first string is the keyspace and
	the second is the key.
